# How good are LLMs at creating presentations?

For this project we looked how LLM generated presentations compared to human generated ones. We each chose topics we had expertise on and created two flash (3 slide) presentations -- one for the AI and one for us. Does the Gamma produce better presentations about something we're an expert in than we do?
