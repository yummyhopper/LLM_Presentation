# How good are LLMs at creating presentations?

For this project we looked how LLM generated presentations compared to human generated ones. We each chose topics we had expertise on and created two flash (3 slide) presentations -- one for the AI and one for us. For the AI presentations we used a free online AI tool called Gamma which we prompted very simply (Ex: Make me a presentation about the Philadelphia Eagles. The idea was to see if the AI could create a better presentation than an actual human expert on a topic and whether or not we could tell them apart. When the class way surveyed about which presentation was which they all most people chose correctly. This was probably because I'm a known Eagles fan and Gabriel is a known Brazilian, however the results of the AI content were still impressive. While the AI used obvious stock footage and kept its answers more factual, our presentations were less structurally sound but more narrative based. See if you can tell which is which.
